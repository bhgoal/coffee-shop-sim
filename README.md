## Summary
Coffee Shop Simulator is an interactive beverage building game where players can simulate working as a barista, making coffee and espresso drinks as fast as possible before time runs out.

## About
It utilizes React to create the user interface, which depicts a barista workstation consisting of a coffee brewer, syrup bottles, espresso machine, refrigerator, and other elements necessary for gameplay.

## Usage:
> node liri.js *command* *searchTerm*

### Command:
- *my-tweets* retrieves the 20 most recent tweets from your Twitter account. No *searchTerm* is necessary.  
- *spotify-this-song* searches the Spotify catalog and returns song information including title, artist, album, and a link to an mp3 preview.  
- *movie-this* searches the IMDB database and returns movie information including title, year, user ratings, plot, and more.  
- *do-what-it-says* allows users to run a custom bulk sequence of commands stored in the random.txt file. Commands must be comma separated, with double quotes around *searchTerms*.

### searchTerm:
*searchTerm* is the content that the user wants to search for, and can be a single word or multiple. It is used for Spotify and IMDB searches, but not for the Twitter function.

## Notes:
Output will be logged to the console as well as to the log.txt file.
